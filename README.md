# Project Title

This project was developed as part of the **SAMSUNG INNOVATION CAMP**, focusing on Machine Learning Model and delivering it to the Farmers end. It utilizes technologies to assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding their farming practices.

# About Dataset

## Context
The science of training machines to learn and produce models for future predictions is widely used, and not for nothing. Agriculture plays a critical role in the global economy. With the continuing expansion of the human population understanding worldwide crop yield is central to addressing food security challenges and reducing the impacts of climate change.

Crop yield prediction is an important agricultural problem. The Agricultural yield primarily depends on weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc), pesticides and accurate information about history of crop yield is an important thing for making decisions related to agricultural risk management and future predictions.

# Farming Planning App

## Overview

The Farming Planning App is designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding their farming practices. Utilizing a machine learning model, the app predicts crop yield based on various factors such as climate conditions, geographic location, pesticide usage, and temperature. This tool aims to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability.

## Features

- **Yield Prediction**: Predicts crop yield based on input parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Kotlin (Android App)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask framework)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Deployment**: Railway
